This repository provides the R files related to the paper titled "Impact of the Error Structure on the Design and Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Models," which was published in Statistics in Biosciences (link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12561-022-09347-5). 

We have calculated the optimal designs for precisely estimating the parameters in enzyme kinetic profiles. This includes the calculation of D and Ds optimal designs. Furthermore, we have compared the corresponding designs based on D and Ds efficiency.

In addition, we have computed optimal discriminating designs, including T-optimal and Î´-optimal designs. The comparison is conducted by evaluating the exact designs using the concept of true classification rates.
